       " 'i had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me i initially ordered the petite small my usual size but i found this to be outrageously small so small in fact that i could not zip it up i reordered it in petite medium which was just ok overall the top half was comfortable and fit nicely but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap net over layers imo a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper   it c',\n",

       " 'i ordered this in carbon for store pick up and had a ton of stuff as always to try on and used this top to pair skirts and pants everything went with it the color is really nice charcoal with shimmer and went well with pencil skirts flare pants etc my only compaint is it is a bit big sleeves are long and it doesnt go in petite also a bit loose for me but no xxs so i kept it and wil ldecide later since the light color is already sold out in hte smallest size',\n",
       " 'i love this dress i usually get an xs but it runs a little snug in bust so i ordered up a size very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style',\n",
       " 'im 55 and 125 lbs i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasnt too long i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses if youre less busty 34b cup or smaller a s petite will fit you perfectly snug but not tight i love that i could dress it up for a party or down for work i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath',\n",
       " 'dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year needless to say it will be going back',\n",
